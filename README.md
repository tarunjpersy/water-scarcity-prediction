## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

The Occurence of Water scarcity/drought have resulted serious impact on health, agriculture, economies, energy and the environment.We help to solve the problem by identifying very quickly, predictive insights about Water scarcity.

### How our technology solution can help

The Model can provide early warning to the authorities and communities.

### Our idea

INSTRUCTIONS: Replace this paragraph with a longer description of your solution. In about 500 words, describe your solution in more detail. Include the real-world problem you identified, describe the technological solution you have created, and explain how itâ€™s an improvement over existing solutions. You can supply additional documentation in this source code repository that you link to as well.

More detail is available in our [description document](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md).

## Technology implementation

### IBM AI service(s) used

IBM Auto AI (Watson Machine learning) - [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai)

The Auto AI graphical tool in Watson Studio analyzes your data and discovers data transformations, algorithms, and parameter settings that work best for your predictive modeling problem. Auto AI displays the results as model candidate pipelines ranked on a leaderboard for you to choose from.

### Solution architecture

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:

## Additional details

_INSTRUCTIONS: The following deliverables are suggested, but **optional**. Additional details like this can help the judges better review your solution. Remove any sections you are not using._

### How to run the project

1. Deploy the application on your local system.
2. Send your POST request to http://localhost:5000/scarcity from your UI. We have used PRD visualization application which helps us showcase the predicted value.
3. Enter all the mandatory fields and as many of the optional fields as known.
